# POW Blockchain  Mining

This repo implements blocks in incremental merkle roots in the
same way that a production blockchain would.

Todo:
- [x] Implement basic blockchain mining
- [ ] Refactor to modularize (it's not a gist, is it?)
- [ ] Implement persistent LevelDB storage
- [ ] Add p2p networking and consensus (reach goal)
